# ESBuild-React template

This is a lightweight template to develop React app using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io).

## Purpose

This project is designed to be used as a template to build a React app lightning-fast.

## Prerequisites

You can use any other package manager like npm, yarn,...etc. But I chose pnpm for this project(That's why you can find `pnpm-lock.yaml` in the root directory).
If you are willing to follow, please [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) first.

## Features

- You can run a development server with `pnpm dev`
- You can build a compiled version inside `/public/bundle` directory, which is shared with the development server with `pnpm build`.
- The commands above should be ultra-fast!ðŸš€

## How to Use

1. Just run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build`. You'll see ;)
